# portfolio-analysis
In this project, we seek to run through some classic as well as modern portfolio construction and asset allocation strategies to gain some insights into the usefulness of standard measures like sharpe ratio. The end goal is to test such strategies to a sufficient level of rigour that we can convincingly employ them into our portfolio rebalancing pipeline. I will start off by testing my own portfolio and the procedures should be generalizable. Let's get started!
