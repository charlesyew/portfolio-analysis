# Portfolio analysis
In this project, we seek to run through some classic and modern portfolio construction and asset allocation strategies like Modern Portfolio Theory (Markovitz, 1952), Black-Litterman Model (Black & Litterman, 1992) , Hierarchical Risk Parity (Lopez de Prado, 2016) etc. to gain some insights into the usefulness of standard risk measures like sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown in constructing a risk-adjusted portfolio. The end goal is to test such strategies to a sufficient level of rigour that we can convincingly employ them into our portfolio rebalancing pipeline. I will start off by testing my own portfolio and the procedures should be generalizable. Let's get started! 

P.S. I am currently doing my my stock research separately so some of the portfolio construction steps are left unexplained. I might look into streamlining the whole process once I am sufficiently satisfied with the methodologies introduced via academic research. 

# Portfolio Construction
Research questions: 
1. How to model expected returns of an individual stock based on its firm characteristics (e.g. market cap, P/B ratio, P/E ratio)? 
2. Does sector specific firm characteristics offer sufficient predictive power on future returns?

# Portfolio Optimization
Research questions: 
1. How to adequetely tackle the problem of overreliance on historical performance (return and risk measures) to compute forward looking asset allocation rules?
